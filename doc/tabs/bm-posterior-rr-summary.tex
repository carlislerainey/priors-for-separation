\caption{This table provides the deciles prior predictive distribution for the
risk-ratio of war in nonnuclear and nuclear dyads. The risk-ratio is
tells us how many times more likely war is in non-nuclear dyads compared
to nuclear dyads. Notice that that the, informative prior suggests a median
risk-ratio of about 20, which is a large, but plausible effect. Gelman's
proposed default prior suggests a slightly smaller median ratio of about 13,
but also allows very large effects. The skeptical prior suggests a median
ratio of about 4 and the enthusiastic prior suggests a median ratio of over
200.}
