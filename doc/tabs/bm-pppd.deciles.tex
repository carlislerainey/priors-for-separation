\caption{This table provides the deciles prior predictive distribution for the 
                  risk-ratio of war in nonnuclear and nuclear dyads. The risk-ratio is 
                  tells us how many times more likely war is in non-nuclear dyads compared 
                  to nuclear dyads. Notice that that the, informative prior suggests a median 
                  risk-ratio of about 20, which is a large, but plausible effect. Gelman's 
                  proposed default prior suggests a slightly smaller median ratio of about 13, 
                  but also allows very large effects. The skeptical prior suggests a median 
                  ratio of about 4 and the enthusiastic prior suggests a median ratio of over 
                  200.}
